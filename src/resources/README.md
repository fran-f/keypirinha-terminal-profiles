# Icons for auto-generated profiles

Windows Terminal can generate a number of predefined profiles, and assigns them
icons included in the application packages. Since I have not found a way to read
those icons directly, I include these icons in the plugin package.

The set can be refreshed running the script `download.bat`, which clones the
[Windows Terminal repository](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/) and extracts
the profile icons. The script assumes that `git` is installed and available on the
path.
